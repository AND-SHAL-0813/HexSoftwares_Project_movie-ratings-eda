# 🎬 Movie Analytics: Ratings & Genre Performance Dashboard
**HexSoftware Data Science Internship | Project 2**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project transforms a raw cinematic dataset into a high-fidelity **Analytics Dashboard**. By performing comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis on thousands of movie records, I identified key success factors in the film industry, analyzed rating distributions, and visualized genre-specific performance metrics using **Python's data science ecosystem**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Data Reliability:** Implement a cleaning pipeline to handle missing values and enforce strict data typing for `IMDb Scores` and `Release Years`.
* **Statistical Profiling:** Calculate and interpret central tendency metrics (Mean, Median, Mode) to understand global user sentiment.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluate rating consistency across genres using advanced statistical visualizations.
* **Dashboard Engineering:** Construct a multi-panel visual interface using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for consolidated data storytelling.

## 📊 Key Insights & Results
| Metric | Finding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Global Sentiment** | The average IMDb score sits at **6.42**, showing a slightly positive user skew. |
| **Rating Consistency** | Boxplot analysis reveals that certain genres maintain higher rating stability than others. |
| **Data Integrity** | Successfully handled missing values across `Genres` and `IMDb Scores` to ensure zero-bias reporting. |
| **Top Performing Genre** | Identified the highest-rated genres by mean score, filtering for volume to ensure statistical significance. |

## 📂 Directory Structure
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step cleaning, math, and visualization logic.
* `scripts/`: Modular Python code for data preprocessing and dashboard generation.
* `visuals/`: High-resolution exports of the Movie Analytics Dashboard.
* `data/`: Source information and schema for the movie dataset used.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `Pandas` (Data Manipulation), `NumPy` (Numerical Ops), `Seaborn` / `Matplotlib` (Advanced Visualization).
